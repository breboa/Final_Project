I've had terrible dark spots from old acne since I was in my early-mid teens. And since then, I've been on the search for a full coverage foundation/cc cream   concealer that didn't make me look and feel like a walking cake. I've tried it all. To get a good amount of coverage, I've had to sacrifice a significant amount of time, foundation, and a natural look--- so my acne scars would disappear but the trade-off was that my face would be cakey and by the end of the day, thick and oily. I didn't really believe the hype when I heard about this foundation. But it does do what it claims to do. When I wore  this foundation out for the first time, I received so many compliments on how much better my skin looked and how much it's improved. My face was dewy, (seemingly) clear, and light--- as opposed to my usual oily then dry then back to oily, (kind of) clear, cakey skin. It's expensive for foundation, but it's worth it because you don't even need to put on so much. If I had to pick a downside to this foundation, it'd be that it enhances the fine lines underneath my eyes when I smile. That and also, I can't seem to find the perfect color yet.

But, I could only use it in the summer time because the shade I bought was a bit too....orange. I was so glad when Sephora started carrying it, because it meant that I could maybe finally find the correct shade. I called and was told by a rep what the numbers meant, and I read other online reviews that said what was cool or warm. However, I still ended up with the exact opposite of what I needed. After the second phone call to Sephora, they got me exactly what I needed. For reference, the whole numbers are a neutral color. The ones ending in .5 are golden. The.25 ones are pinkish. And, the .75 are ""warm neutral golden."" The is exactly what the second Sephora rep told me.

For reference, I am a perfect match to YSL Fusion Ink Foundation in the shade BR30 (cool almond). I love the Fusion Ink, but I needed something with a bit more coverage, staying power and without sunscreen for my upcoming wedding.

I ended up getting the Luminous Silk in 5.25. (my old shade that was too orange was 5.5). The 5.25 is absolutely perfect.

I wish they would publish what the numbers mean online in the description. It would have saved me numerous returns and hassle trying to find the right one.

I have oily skin, and this stays on all day with only minor blotting. Feels light and doesn't look cakey.

Sometimes its hard for us pinky gals to find the right color because so many foundations lean towards the yellow side.","Omaha, NE",35to44,light,oily,GIORGIO ARMANI BEAUTY,Luminous Silk Foundation,64.0,Medium,Natural,Liquid,True,True,True,True,False

I have extremely oily skin. Oil peeks through within an hour, and by midday, my face is a glazed donut. It doesn't matter what type of foundation I use-powder, liquid, cream-my base will be sliding off my face by the end of the day. I've always bought matte or long lasting formulas to delay the inevitable, but what I find is that many of those type of formulas end up looking heavy. I've begun trying ""luminous"" formulas to achieve a more skin-like finish. Now that I've tried this, I'm not going back. 
Do I get shiny? Yes. But that would happen with any foundation (it's been a long road to acceptance). The difference is that this foundation makes my skin look SO good. I have redness along my cheeks and nose, it evens out those areas effortlessly. It leaves a satin finish that looks like you're not wearing anything, just soft, glowing skin. 
I have to use a loose powder to set (Laura Mercier, Kat Von D and Ben Nye all work well), and I do have to blot later in the day. It gets me through the workday, but if I'm heading out after work, I definitely need to touch up. That's not bad, considering how oily my skin is. 
I have light medium olive skin. In general, it's difficult to find foundations to match my undertone. Armani foundations lean more pink to neutral. I use shade 6.0. It has a golden undertone compared to the other shades, but I wish they could make it just a smidge more yellow, because it does lean neutral. I'm being nit picky, because the shade works, most can't tell that the undertone is slightly off. That's the other thing! My coworkers thought I had stopped using foundation, they thought I had perfect skin.
The biggest con is the cost. It is expensive, and I danced around the thought of buying it for a year. I got a couple samples to find the right shade.

First, though it says medium coverage, one layer is more like in between medium and full coverage and it is very build able. It blends seamlessly into the skin and does not look cake.

Second, it has a very wide shade range, which I loved! I am light-medium, with a neutral undertone, so I find that cool foundations wash me out and warm foundations are too orangey on my skin. I found the perfect shade for me in 4.25.

Third, as you may have heard this is the perfect foundation for flash photography. My skin looks just flawless. I took a polaroid with my friends and my skin just glowed in the photo, which was a first for me.

Fourth, this was a little too heavy for my daily wear, mostly because i don't have any heavy skin imperfections so for me I am not looking for a lot of coverage during the day, so I have begun using this as my go-to foundations for night outs.

And lastly, if you're looking for a daily, good coverage foundation, then this it. It's beautiful and holds up great through out the day.

I have been using it for a few years now and have repurchased this foundation so many times - its so worth the money! The coverage is amazing, its a true full coverage and long wearing. foundation If you are plan to use this foundation is you MUST prep your skin beforehand if you want to achieve the best results and most flawless look.

This is not a foundation that you can simply put on and go out the door. Because it is so full coverage, its less forgiving for pores and dryness - you really need to cleanse your face well, moisturize and prime before you use this foundation. The primer I love to use before it is benefit ""the porefessional"" and to intensify the long wearing ability sometimes I use the urban decay de-slick for humid and long nights.

You can apply this foundation a number of ways: your fingers, synthetic brushes, or a beauty sponge. It dries very quickly so work with smaller sections. The beauty blender offers a lighter coverage if you think it is too heavy for everyday.

Overall this is a great foundation, it covers extremely well there is no need for concealer (except for under your eyes) and it dries matte and lasts so long. It doesn't melt away like other foundations. You dont need to set this foundation, only touch ups in the t-zone when it gets shiny. For anyone who wants extreme coverage, like revlon colorstay or mac studio fix, but want a longer lasting result use this foundation!

The coverage is amazing, in fact I find myself rarely using concealer! If I do use concealer I only use a little bit, but otherwise this foundation does it all. It stays on all day (with powder of course) and it lasts for up to 15 hours, it doesn't look as perfect as it does in the beginning by the 10th hour (I sweat a lot) but it doesn't look bad and it doesn't feel nasty or sticky throughout the day. In fact sometimes I forget that I'm wearing any makeup at all whenever I wear this. Even when I touch my face it feels so smooth and almost like skin. I recommend using the Nars Light Reflecting loose setting powder to set this foundation because the coverage is so full, all you need is a translucent powder and Nars mixes perfectly with this ! The only con about this product is it doesn't have a pump (so watch out how much product you pour out!) and I feel like the bottle is pretty small for someone who wears makeup 5 days a week. Usually it lasts me 2-3 months until I have to buy another bottle. Other wise this foundation is perfect and so underrated and honestly if you struggle with acne prone skin, I really recommend you try this foundation.","Queens, New York",18to24,fair,combination,ESTÉE LAUDER,Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation,43.0,Full,Matte,Liquid,False,True,True,False,False

Now that I am 47 I am starting to get age spots and of course they're on my face. It's horrifying. This is the only foundation so far that had enough coverage to make me look okay again.  I'm so happy that I have two big bottles of it right now but I'm still testing other foundations to see if I can find more that work just as well. So far nothing has even come close. I just bought Lancome Ultra wear and my age spots show right through it. this is a truly incredible makeup. It makes my skin look almost as good as when I was 25. I am not exaggerating and no one's having me write this review.

I have tried many foundations in the past and I have finally found her! I have sensitive skin and this foundation does not make me break out. The formula is buildable and hides any imprerfections you may have. I have some acne scarring and a dark spot and this covers it all up beautifully. It doesnt feel cakely on the skin, and applies beautifully with a stippling brush or beauty blender. I love that there are many different shaes. I am in the shade 4w1 Honey Bronze, I have brown (Indian) skin with yellow undertones and use this shade in the summer for when I'm tanned. If you have south asian/olive/brown/tanned skin you'll know it's hard to find the right shade, but I recommend this foundation if you have trouble finding the right shade for you since there are so many options! This foundation will also last all day. I can put it on in the morning, go to work and go out after work and I know my foundation still looks good. I'll also add that it has a powder finish which is nice as you dont need to set your foundation but if you're like me and still ""have to"", you dont need as much powder with this one. Can you tell I'm in love?","Toronto, ON",25to34,olive,combination,ESTÉE LAUDER,Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation,43.0,Full,Matte,Liquid,False,True,True,False,False

After many months of trying to tick all my foundation requirement boxes, I thought the search was over when I stumbled upon this gem. Allow me to take a moment to say how GORGEOUS this foundation wears throughout my 10+ hour days while only needing to blot once. Never have I ever been so excited to pass a reflective surface and give a content sigh thinking, 'Ah, just as I applied you..'

So why 4 stars and not 5? 
While I adore this foundation, I cannot wear it. 

I break out once a month and once a month only, in small unimpressive blemishes. But when I was hit with a barrage of cystic acne after a week of using DW, on my off cycle, and with no changes in my stress levels, diet, or skincare, I couldn't continue. 

Missing all the wonderful things the foundation provided a month or so later I tried again, only to have more cystic acne, but this time in only 3 days of wear, again off cycle and no lifestyle changes. 

I believe that the foundation itself is just too heavy for my skin to manage. The beauty blender, a flat top brush, a round buffing brush, and my fingers didn't change the fact that the product had weight to it, I just didn't think it would pose an issue.

It's disappointing that I not only had to return my DW, but I'm still on the hunt for that perfect base. I'm excited to see what Double Wear Light has to offer, as I'll be testing it this week in shade Intensity 3.5.

I encourage everyone to give the mother of all foundations a try at least once. The coverage, shade range and hours and hours of wear time can't be beat. It works for a lot of people with different skin types, tones, moisture levels and sensitivities. Unfortunately, I just wasn't one of them.","Santa Barbara, CA",18to24,medium,oily,ESTÉE LAUDER,Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation,43.0,Full,Matte,Liquid,False,True,True,False,False
